## Docker Tools

[Docker](https://www.docker.com/) is an open platform for developing, shipping, and running applications. Docker enables you to separate your applications from your infrastructure so you can deliver software quickly working in collaboration with cloud, Linux, and Windows vendors, including Microsoft.

[Docker Enterprise](https://www.mirantis.com/software/docker/docker-enterprise/) is a subscription including software, supported and certified container platform for CentOS, Red Hat Enterprise Linux (RHEL), Ubuntu, SUSE Linux Enterprise Server (SLES), Oracle Linux, and Windows Server 2016, as well as for cloud providers AWS and Azure.

[Docker Desktop](https://www.docker.com/products/docker-desktop) is an application for MacOS and Windows machines for the building and sharing of containerized applications and microservices. Docker Desktop delivers the speed, choice and security you need for designing and delivering containerized applications on your desktop. Docker Desktop includes Docker App, developer tools, Kubernetes and version synchronization to production Docker Engines.

[Docker Hub](https://hub.docker.com/) is the world's largest library and community for container images Browse over 100,000 container images from software vendors, open-source projects, and the community.

[Docker Compose](https://docs.docker.com/compose/) is a tool that was developed to help define and share multi-container applications. With Docker Compose, you can create a YAML file to define the services and with a single command, can spin everything up or tear it all down.

[Docker Swarm](https://docs.docker.com/engine/swarm/) is a Docker-native clustering system swarm is a simple tool which controls a cluster of Docker hosts and exposes it as a single "virtual" host.

[Dockerfile](https://docs.docker.com/engine/reference/builder/) is a text document that contains all the commands a user could call on the command line to assemble an image. Using docker build users can create an automated build that executes several command-line instructions in succession.

[Docker Images](https://docs.docker.com/engine/reference/commandline/images/) is a lightweight, standalone, executable package of software that includes everything needed to run an application: code, runtime, system tools, system libraries and settings. Images have intermediate layers that increase reusability, decrease disk usage, and speed up docker build by allowing each step to be cached. These intermediate layers are not shown by default. The SIZE is the cumulative space taken up by the image and all its parent images.

[Docker Network](https://docs.docker.com/engine/reference/commandline/network/) is a that displays detailed information on one or more networks.

[Docker Daemon](https://docs.docker.com/config/daemon/) is a service started by a system utility, not manually by a user. This makes it easier to automatically start Docker when the machine reboots. The command to start Docker depends on your operating system. Currently, it only runs on Linux because it depends on a number of Linux kernel features, but there are a few ways to run Docker on MacOS and Windows as well by configuring the operating system utilities.

[Docker Storage](https://docs.docker.com/storage/storagedriver/select-storage-driver/) is a driver controls how images and containers are stored and managed on your Docker host.

[Podman](https://podman.io/) is a daemonless, open source, Linux native tool designed to make it easy to find, run, build, share and deploy applications using Open Containers Initiative (OCI) Containers and Container Images. Podman provides a command line interface (CLI) familiar to anyone who has used the Docker Container Engine.

[Containerd](https://containerd.io) is a daemon that manages the complete container lifecycle of its host system, from image transfer and storage to container execution and supervision to low-level storage to network attachments and beyond. It is available for Linux and Windows.
